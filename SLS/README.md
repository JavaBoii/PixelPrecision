# About
This Part of the Project is the Automated Shell Loading System (SLS) for the Artillery System. <br>
It is designed to automatically prepare shells with various powder charges as requested by either the user or the cannon. <br>
The system is designed to be modular and expandable, allowing for easy integration into any existing artillery system.

</details>

To set up the SLS, you will need to follow the following steps:
1. **Computer/Monitor Setup**: Place down 5 computers. **Beware to leave a spaces open as shown in the picture above**. Place down 5 Monitors either directly in contact with the computer or connected via cables.
    - It is recommended to connect all monitors via 1 cable and use that cable to connect to the computer. Thus the computers can show you available monitors in the network.<br><br>
2. **Download Helper**: On each computer, download `RoleAssignmentScript.lua` by using the following command. <br>
    ```shell
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavaBoii/PixelPrecision/master/SLS/src/setup/RoleAssignmentScript.lua
    ```
3. **Assign Roles**: Run the `RoleAssignmentScript.lua` on each computer to assign the roles to the computers. <br>
    ```shell
    RoleAssignmentScript.lua
    ```
4. **Initialization Order**: Load the scripts in the following order to ensure proper system initialization:
    - Monitoring Station
    - Powder Charge Manager
    - Safeguard
    - Item Manager
    - Order Management System

By following these steps, your Automated Powder Charge System should now be prepared for use. <br>
Now you can start the programs and follow the directions shown on screen.
